# FittsLaw

A simple game to test the useability of a controller or mouse setup based on the fitts's law tests outlined by I. Scott MacKenzie.
Run setup.py to adjust the settings for each user.
Targets can be set to randomly selected ring sizes and widths or to use a set to keep consistancy between tests. See set1.csv for an example of how this should be written.
